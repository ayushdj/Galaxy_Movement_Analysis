Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has been a very successful theory on length scales in the universe that are bigger than the sizes of typically large and bright galaxies such as our own Milky Way. The motivation behind this project was to use the motions of satellite galaxies, orbiting around large and bright host galaxies, as a test of CDM in situations where it hasnâ€™t been tested well to date, or has been problematic in reproducing the observed universe. This project measured the distribution of the velocities of the satellite galaxies relative to their hosts. This was done by creating seven histograms of the relative velocity differences (in the x, y and z directions) between the hosts and the satellites, and subdividing them by a 3D distance. The results show that the distributions are well-fitted by Gaussians, and that the velocity dispersion (as determined by Gaussian statistics) decreases monotonically with the host-satellite 3D distance.
