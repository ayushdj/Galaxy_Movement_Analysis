# Abstract

Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has been a very successful theory on length scales in the universe that are bigger than the sizes of typically large and bright galaxies such as our own Milky Way. The motivation behind this project was to use the motions of satellite galaxies, orbiting around large and bright host galaxies, as a test of CDM in situations where it hasn’t been tested well to date, or has been problematic in reproducing the observed universe. This project measured the distribution of the velocities of the satellite galaxies relative to their hosts. This was done by creating seven histograms of the relative velocity differences (in the x, y and z directions) between the hosts and the satellites, and subdividing them by a 3D distance. The results show that the distributions are well-fitted by Gaussians, and that the velocity dispersion (as determined by Gaussian statistics) decreases monotonically with the host-satellite 3D distance.

# Introduction

Dark Matter is one of the most popularly researched topics in astrophysics today, as this theorized particle is responsible for roughly 85% of the mass of current observable universe. However the main challenge associated with studying this particle is that it is not directly observable, as it does not emit any light. As a result, we used simulated data,specifically from the Illustris-1 Simulation [http://www.illustris-project.org/]. The major motivating factor of this project was the fact that Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has provided a strong theoretical framework for the structure and formation of typical large bright galaxies such as the Milky Way galaxy.

# Research Goals

We aimed to determine whether the velocity dispersion profiles of light-emitting satellite galaxies (galaxies that are gravitationally bound to and orbiting, larger “host” galaxies) accurately trace the velocity dispersion profiles of the CDM halos that surround large and bright galaxies. If there is a similarity, then the conclusion will be that observers should seek to use the motions of satellite galaxies (with respect to their hosts) in order to infer the motion of dark matter in the universe.
